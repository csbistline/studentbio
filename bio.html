    <p>If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Let's have a little bit of fun today. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
    <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.
